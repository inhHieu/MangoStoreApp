# mango

This project is for one of the subjects in my university, where I had the opportunity to learn about Flutter and mobile development. 
It was intended to be a team project, but I ended up working on it by myself. There's no shame on my friends, it's just one of those things that happen when we're young and inexperienced.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
